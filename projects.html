            <p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a debilitating neurological condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention and treatment. This project focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning methods to analyze 3D brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) for the detection of AD, Healthy Control (HC), and the intermediate stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).</p>

            <p class="align-justify">The methodology involves adapting a sophisticated deep-learning model previously developed for AD classification. Post hoc explanations are incorporated using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), enhancing interpretability. The extension of the model to include MCI aims to address the challenge of identifying patients in this critical intermediate stage.</p>
            <p class="align-justify"> Key findings from the analysis include the identification of diagnostic hallmarks in hippocampal and ventricular brain regions, aligning with established literature. The AD score distribution demonstrates distinct mean values for HC and AD classes, showcasing the model's discriminatory capabilities.</p>
            <p class="align-justify">However, the project reveals challenges in multi-class classification, indicating the difficulty distinguishing MCI from HC and AD. The study also suggests future directions, such as incorporating additional risk factors like age to enhance classification accuracy.</p>
            <p class="align-justify">In summary, this project contributes to advancing AD detection using deep learning, providing insights into model performance, interpretability, and potential enhancements for more accurate classification in complex MCI scenarios. The combination of advanced AI techniques and a nuanced understanding of model outputs offers promise for improving clinical decision-making in diagnosing neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

          <p>Our research project focuses on the intersection of cryptocurrency markets, with a particular emphasis on Dogecoin, a notable cryptocurrency, and the impact of Elon Musk's tweets on its price trajectory. Cryptocurrencies, especially Dogecoin, have gained significant attention in financial circles, often influenced by high-profile figures like Elon Musk.</p>

            <p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between Dogecoin's price movements and the sentiments expressed in Elon Musk's tweets related to Dogecoin, we conducted a thorough investigation. Recognizing the limitations of relying solely on a single influencer's data, we expanded our analysis to include tweets from various users, creating a more robust dataset. Leveraging Twitter's API, we collected and meticulously processed over 45,000 tweets, employing advanced sentiment analysis models for in-depth examination.</p>
            
            <p>Our analysis results reveal a discernible connection between Elon Musk's tweets and the price dynamics of Dogecoin. However, interestingly, this correlation is not reflected in the broader spectrum of Dogecoin-related tweets originating from the wider Twitter user community. Our findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between social media sentiments, individual influencers, and the cryptocurrency market, offering valuable insights into the complex dynamics at play in this rapidly evolving financial landscape.</p>

          <p>The focus of this internship project is to explore and develop Intent-Based Dialog Systems (IBDS) and address the challenges associated with modular structures in such systems. In practical applications, Dialog Systems (DS) are often designed with a modular approach, combining multiple DS into a unified system known as Modular Dialog Systems (MDS).

          <p>The project introduces the concept of Intent-Based Dialog Systems (IBDS), which differ from traditional research-oriented dialog systems by employing rule-based Dialog Managers (DM) in industry applications. The absence of an established term for such systems in the literature leads to the adoption of "Intent-Based Dialog Systems."</p>
            
          <p>The core challenge addressed in the project is the task of module selection (MS) in IBDS. This involves choosing the appropriate sub-DS for each user utterance to generate a unified response. This problem is particularly relevant in industry applications where IBDS, relying on rule-based DM, combines multiple dialog systems with different intents and architectures.</p>
            
          <p>The project contributes significantly to the scientific literature by formally introducing the novel task of MS and providing an evaluation framework for this task. A benchmark dataset is proposed to evaluate models for MS, and three baseline models are presented. The experiments conducted demonstrate the importance of the user utterance text as a more robust feature for MS models compared to confidence values of Intent Detection (ID).</p>
            
          <p>In summary, the internship project makes valuable contributions to advancing the understanding and development of Intent-Based Dialog Systems. It addresses the unique challenges posed by modular structures in practical applications and provides a clear evaluation framework for the task of module selection.</p>
